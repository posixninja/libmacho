libmacho - Mach-O inspection helpers
====================================

This library provides a lightweight parser for Mach-O binaries along with the
`machoman` utility. Recent updates add a proper abstraction layer for 32-bit and
64-bit images, native FAT binary awareness, and utility helpers for working with
multi-architecture files.

Highlights
----------
- Unified 32/64-bit architecture operations exposed through `macho/arch.h`.
- Automatic FAT binary detection with slice selection via `macho_select_architecture()`.
- Buffer and file level helpers in `macho/fat.h` to thin or combine executables.
- `machoman` gained the `--arch CPU[:SUB]` option to inspect a specific slice.

See `machoman --help` for usage examples or inspect `include/macho/*.h` for the
public API surface.
