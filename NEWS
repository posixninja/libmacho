libmacho - Recent changes
=========================

- Added architecture abstraction helpers that split the parsing logic for
  32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O images while keeping a single public API.
- Introduced a FAT parser (`macho/fat.h`) plus helpers to thin or combine
  multi-architecture executables.
- `machoman` now accepts `--arch CPU[:SUB]` to inspect a specific slice inside a
  FAT binary.
